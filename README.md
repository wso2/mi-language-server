Micro Integrator Language Server 
================================
This repository is a fork of [Eclipse LemMinX](https://github.com/eclipse/lemminx).

**MI Language Server** is a language specific implementation of the [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol)
and can be used with any editor that supports the protocol, to offer good support for the **MI (Synapse) Language**.

The server is based on:

 * [Eclipse LSP4J](https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4j), the Java binding for the Language Server Protocol.
 * Xerces to manage XML Schema validation, completion and hover

Get started
--------------
* Clone this repository
* Open the folder in your terminal / command line
* Run `./mvnw clean verify` (OSX, Linux) or `mvnw.cmd clean verify` (Windows)
* After successful compilation you can find the resulting `org.eclipse.lemminx-uber.jar` in the folder `org.eclipse.lemminx/target`

Developer
--------------

To debug the XML LS you can use XMLServerSocketLauncher:

1. Run the XMLServerSocketLauncher in debug mode (e.g. in eclipse)
2. Connect your client via socket port. Default port is 5008, but you can change it with start argument `--port` in step 1

Client connection example using Theia and TypeScript:

```js
let socketPort = '5008'
console.log(`Connecting via port ${socketPort}`)
const socket = new net.Socket()
const serverConnection = createSocketConnection(socket,
    socket, () => {
        socket.destroy()
    });
this.forward(clientConnection, serverConnection)
socket.connect(socketPort)
```
